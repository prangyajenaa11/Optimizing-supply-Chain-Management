# Optimizing Supply Chain Management: A Collaborative Project with Cognizant

## Project Overview
This project, in partnership with Cognizant, aims to transform the supply chain management process for a top-tier client. Using advanced data science and AI techniques, the project provides strategic recommendations and insights to optimize various aspects of the client’s supply chain operations.

## Project Objectives
Key objectives of this project include:

1. **Predict Demand**: Apply machine learning models to forecast demand, minimizing supply chain disruptions.
2. **Enhance Inventory Management**: Optimize stock levels to reduce waste and improve efficiency.
3. **Identify Latent Patterns**: Discover insights from historical data and market trends to support better decision-making.
4. **Improve Distribution Efficiency**: Streamline distribution channels to boost customer satisfaction and reduce costs.
5. **Cost Optimization**: Recommend cost-saving strategies that maintain quality.

## Data Sources
The project involves analyzing multiple data sources, including:

- Historical supply chain data
- Market trends
- External factors like economic conditions and seasonality

## Project Components
The project workflow is organized into several stages:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract key features impacting supply chain performance.
3. **Model Selection**: Select appropriate machine learning models (e.g., regression, classification, clustering, predictive models).
4. **Model Training & Validation**: Train models on relevant data and validate their performance.
5. **Deployment of Models**: Integrate models into the client’s supply chain management system to provide real-time insights.

## Machine Learning Techniques
The project employs various machine learning techniques, including:

- **Regression Analysis**: For demand forecasting.
